Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is a framework that enables AI models to maintain persistent state and enhanced reasoning capabilities across multiple interactions.
What makes MCP special:

Persistent state management: Unlike traditional AI interactions where context is limited to the conversation history, MCP allows models to maintain a structured state that persists throughout an interaction session.
Enhanced reasoning capabilities: MCP enables more sophisticated reasoning by maintaining explicit working memory, allowing models to track complex information and state changes over time.
Structured framework: It provides a consistent approach for models to organize their thinking, manage assumptions, track key information, and manage updates to their understanding.

What makes MCP unique in the AI world:

Bridge between stateless and stateful AI: Traditional large language models are fundamentally stateless - they predict the next token based only on the provided input. MCP creates a bridge to more stateful reasoning without changing the underlying architecture.
Explicit metacognition: MCP encourages models to engage in metacognition - thinking about their own thinking - and to explicitly track their reasoning processes.
Improved consistency: By maintaining explicit state, models using MCP tend to be more consistent across interactions and less prone to contradicting themselves.
Self-correction mechanism: The protocol includes mechanisms for the model to review and update its understanding, creating opportunities for self-correction.
Enhanced transparency: The explicit tracking of state, assumptions, and key information makes the model's reasoning process more transparent to users.

MCP represents an innovative approach to improving model capabilities through better context management without requiring significant architectural changes to the underlying AI systems.

u are working with:
✅ 1. Agents — the "brains" that use context

    An agent is an AI that thinks, plans, responds, or acts.

    Examples:

        GPT-4 responding to you

        A task-based assistant running in LangGraph or CrewAI

        Claude, DeepSeek, or an open-source LLM acting with a goal

✅ 2. Servers / Context Stores — the "memory" those agents use

    These store long-term state: goals, preferences, task history, etc.

    Think of it like a notebook the agent writes in and reads from

    The server exposes an API — via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

✅ 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) — the "language" connecting the two

    It’s the standard way agents and servers communicate

    Just like HTTP lets browsers talk to websites, MCP lets agents talk to context stores

    It lets you switch between agents, as long as they all “speak MCP”
