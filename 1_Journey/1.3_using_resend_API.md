Send it using MCP with resend API

GitHub Copilot
To send the email using MCP (Model Context Protocol) with the Resend API, I need to know how your MCP integration is set up. If you have an MCP server or client in your project, I can help you refactor the code to send the email via MCP instead of calling the Resend API directly in run.js.

Could you clarify:

Do you have an MCP server or client already implemented?
Should the email sending be triggered by an MCP request, or should the MCP server itself send the email?
If you have an MCP handler or endpoint for sending emails, I can move the Resend logic into that handler and show you how to trigger it via MCP. If not, I can help you set up a basic MCP endpoint for this purpose.

Please let me know your MCP setup, or if you want me to create a new MCP handler for sending emails!
